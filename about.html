                    <h5>150+ courses</h5>
                    <p>Many prestigious colleges and universities now offer online degree options. An online degree from a major institution typically has the same value as one you earned in person and may even expose you to more rigorous coursework or skills development. On Coursera, you can find degrees from the University of London, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, Penn State, and HEC Paris.  Online courses are convenient. The biggest advantage of an online course is that your classroom and instructor (theoretically) are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Your only excuse for missing class is not getting online! Otherwise, everything is available to you.</p>

                    <h5>World class mentors</h5>
                    <p> Diversity yields greater perspectives and insights. Thanks to the global availability of online learning, you may find yourself enrolled alongside students from around the world, which may in turn foster broader, more diverse opinions and learning. Moreover, depending on your program, you may have the opportunity to engage with your classmates as much as you want. Use the resources available in your program to connect with other students or maybe even start a virtual club to help stay in touch or keep each other on track.  
                        Beyond tuition and fees, there are a lot of costs associated with attending college or university—or a workshop, course, or certificate program—in person. With online learning, you tend to benefit from lower overall costs because there’s less overhead associated with operating each program. While the average cost for one tuition credit in the United States was relatively the same for online and in-state students at the same institution, according to the Education Data Initiative, that doesn’t take into account the additional fees typically associated with the full cost of in-person attendance, such as housing and transportation.
